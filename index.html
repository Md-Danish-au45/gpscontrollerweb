The GPS device installed in your vehicle receives signals from multiple satellites, calculates its position, and transmits this data through 4G or cellular network to our cloud servers. You can then view the live location, speed, route history, and other details through our web dashboard or mobile app. The system updates location every 1-10 seconds depending on your chosen plan and provides accurate positioning within 3-5 meters."

The accuracy depends on several factors: number of satellites in view (minimum 4 required, better with 8-12 satellites), quality of GPS antenna, environmental conditions, and whether the device supports multi-constellation GNSS (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou). Our premium trackers support all four systems for 99.9% accuracy even in urban canyons or dense areas. The devices also use A-GPS (Assisted GPS) and cellular tower triangulation for faster location fixes and backup when satellite signals are weak."

You have every right to track your own vehicle for theft prevention, fleet management, or family safety. However, it is illegal to install GPS tracker on someone else's vehicle without their knowledge or consent, as this violates privacy laws. For commercial fleets, employers must inform drivers about GPS tracking as per labor laws. Our GPS tracking systems comply with all Indian Telegraph Act regulations and data protection guidelines. We use encrypted data transmission and secure cloud storage to protect your privacy."

            "text": "GPS tracker battery life depends on the device type and usage pattern. Portable battery-powered GPS trackers typically last 7-30 days on a single charge with normal tracking (updates every 60 seconds). Our long-life asset trackers can last up to 3 years with scheduled tracking (4 updates per day). Vehicle hardwired GPS trackers don't need charging as they connect directly to vehicle battery. OBD GPS trackers are powered by the vehicle's OBD port. Battery life also depends on tracking frequency - more frequent updates (every 5-10 seconds) drain battery faster. Sleep mode and smart tracking algorithms help extend battery life. We recommend hardwired installation for vehicles used daily and battery-powered trackers for assets or occasionally used vehicles."
